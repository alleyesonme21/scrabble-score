# Make a console application that takes a word and returns the Scrabble score for that word. Make sure to start with your specs, and that you include a README for this project and create a Git repository for it. Here are the values of letters in Scrabble:

```
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
